This project was made for the NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2023, for the first leg of the competition in Ankara. 
Sadly we weren't able to qualify for the last round and we haven't developed it since the competition.
We weren't thinkin of doing anything with it so we decided to publish it on GitHub.
But we decided not to include the source code as it would hinder the hackathon.

So in the end, you're free examine it as much as you like but please don't attempt to send it as your own project in the hackathon. (Don't ruin it for others.)
